# Firebase Quickstart

> Start here! Learn the fundamentals of Firebase with vanilla JS to prepare you for other frameworks.

[Firebase](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tags/firebase) makes app development faster ‚ö°, cheaper üíµ, and more enjoyable üòÄ for developers. The idea behind a **Backend-as-a-Service** (BaaS) is to eliminate the need to write and maintain server-side code - things like user authentication, trusted API calls, security logic, database connections, traffic scaling, and the list goes on. These requirements take time, money, and add complexity to a project. The more resources you can invest in the frontend user experience, the more likely your app is to succeed. Firebase makes this possible by providing you with a variety of frontend SDKs that connect your web/mobile apps to various Google Cloud Resources.

The following lesson is a step-by-step breakdown of the basics of Firebase intended for both beginners and experienced users. My goal is to give you a foundation of knowledge that every Firebase developer should know‚Ä¶

*   Use the Firebase CLI Tools to manage and deploy an app. (hosting)
*   Setup basic user auth with Google Sign-In. (authentication)
*   Create Firestore database records and listen to changes in realtime. (firestore)

Getting Started
---------------

### Create a Firebase Project

A Firebase project is a container for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) infrastructure. A project can have multiple apps - it is common for web, iOS, and Android apps to share the same project. Create a new [project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) from the dashboard.

### Add Firebase to a Web App

In order to use Firebase in a frontend web or mobile app, you must add an app to your project - this step generates credentials that will connect your app to the cloud. Navigate to ‚öôÔ∏è _settings_ and click the _Add app_ button.

![Create a web app from the project settings panel](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/firebase-web-app.png)

Create a web app from the project settings panel

This will generate a config snippet that can be added to any Firebase project. Let‚Äôs create an extremely simple web app that consists of an _public/index.html_ file and _public/app.js_ file.

![](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/project-files.png)

In the `<head>` of the HTML file, paste the snippet. Also, include script tags for the Auth and Firestore SDKs because they will be needed in the upcoming section. Including these script tags extends the core SDK with the features we plan on using (firestore and auth).

üí° In VS Code you can type the `!` followed by tab to quickly generate HTML boilerplate.

file\_type\_html index.html

    <head>
      <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.16.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
      <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.16.1/firebase-auth.js"></script>
      <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.16.1/firebase-firestore.js"></script>
    
      <script>
        var firebaseConfig = {
          // TODO: Add your our config here
        };
        firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
      </script>
    
      <script src="app.js" defer></script>
    </head>
    
    <body>
    
        <h1>My Awesome App üî•</h1>
    
    </body>
    

In your JavaScript code, you can now reference `firebase`as a global variable. Log it out to make sure everything works.

file\_type\_js\_official app.js

### Firebase CLI Tools

Now we‚Äôre ready to connect our local code to the cloud via the Firebase Tools CLIs. Run the following commands to connect your terminal to the cloud.

command line

    npm install -g firebase-tools
    
    firebase login
    
    firebase init
    
    firebase serve
    

When initializing the project, select _hosting_ and and _emulators_. Select YES for single page application, then choose the defaults for all other options. After running the serve command, you should see your site on `http://localhost:5000` in the browser.

üí° Optional. It‚Äôs also a good idea to install the [Firebase Explorer VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsayol.firebase-explorer) extension.

üî• Also checkout the [Advanced Firebase Emulator Guide](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/lessons/firebase-emulator-advanced/)

### Deploy to Hosting

It‚Äôs very satisfying to launch your stuff to the Internet - Firebase makes deployment dead simple.

command line

![And we&rsquo;re live](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/hosting-deploy.png)

And we‚Äôre live

Your app is now available on the web at the domains listed in the _hosting_ console.

User Authentication
-------------------

When starting with a new project, most of my focus goes into the user authentication flow. Many critical features need a signed-in user, so it‚Äôs a logical place to start. Firebase Auth provides a variety of ways to get users signed-in, but let‚Äôs stick with the easiest option - Google Sign-in.

üî• Also checkout the [auth tag](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/tags/auth/) for more advanced sign-in flows.

### Enable Google Auth

From the Firebase Console, go to **Authentication ¬ª Sign-in Method**. Enable Google.

![Enable Google Sign-in](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/auth-google.png)

Enable Google Sign-in

### Add SignIn and SignOut Buttons

First, we need some HTML to provide the UI for signed-in and signed-out users. The signed-in section will be hidden by default.

file\_type\_html index.html

      <section id="whenSignedOut">
    
        <button id="signInBtn">Sign in with Google</button>
    
      </section>
    
      <section id="whenSignedIn" hidden="true">
    
        <div id="userDetails"></div>
    
        <button id="signOutBtn">Sign Out</button>
    
      </section>
    
    

Next, we can grab the buttons from the HTML and register and event handler function using `onclick`. When clicked the button will use the `signInWithPopup` method from the auth SDK to open a window prompting the user to enter their Google credentials. Firebase creates JSON Web Token (JWT) that identifies the user on this browser and keeps them authenticated until the token is invalidated or destroyed by clicking sign-out.

file\_type\_js\_official app.js

    const signInBtn = document.getElementById('signInBtn');
    const signOutBtn = document.getElementById('signOutBtn');
    
    const auth = firebase.auth();
    const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
    
    /// Sign in event handlers
    
    signInBtn.onclick = () => auth.signInWithPopup(provider);
    
    signOutBtn.onclick = () => auth.signOut();
    

### Listen to changes to the Auth State

The `onAuthStateChanged` method runs a callback function each time the user‚Äôs auth state changes. If signed-in, the `user` param will be an object containing the user‚Äôs UID, email address, etc. If signed-out it will be null.

file\_type\_js\_official app.js

    const whenSignedIn = document.getElementById('whenSignedIn');
    const whenSignedOut = document.getElementById('whenSignedOut');
    const userDetails = document.getElementById('userDetails');
    
    auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
        if (user) {
            // signed in
            whenSignedIn.hidden = false;
            whenSignedOut.hidden = true;
            userDetails.innerHTML = `<h3>Hello ${user.displayName}!</h3> <p>User ID: ${user.uid}</p>`;
        } else {
            // not signed in
            whenSignedIn.hidden = true;
            whenSignedOut.hidden = false;
            userDetails.innerHTML = '';
        }
    });

Firestore
---------

Once you have a user authenticated, you probably want that user do something interesting, which typically means saving records to a database. [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) is a NoSQL [document-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) database similar to MongoDB. It‚Äôs easy to manage and flexible, but modeling data relationships can be somewhat challenging. From the Firebase console, enable Firestore.

![Enable Firestore in test mode. We will secure the database at the end of this tutorial.](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/firestore-enable.png)

Enable Firestore in test mode. We will secure the database at the end of this tutorial.

### Data Model

In this example we have a `things` collection. Our goal is to create a relationship between the currently signed-in user and Firestore where a user can _have many_ things, while each thing _belongs to_ one user. One way to model relationship is to save the user‚Äôs `uid` value on each document like so:

![](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/firestore-things.png)

üî• Checkout the [Firestore data modeling](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/courses/firestore-data-modeling/) course for more common data modeling examples.

### Writing to the Database

Now it‚Äôs time to give our user a way to create database records. Let‚Äôs start by adding some HTML where we can render out the items in the database.

file\_type\_html index.html

      <section>
    
        <h2>My Firestore Things</h2>
    
        <ul id="thingsList"></ul>
    
        <button id="createThing">Create a Thing</button>
    
      </section>
    

Because the user must be signed-in, our code only runs when we have access to a user. The `thingsRef` points to a collection the database and provides methods to read and write to this location. Create a new document in the collection with `add`, where the argument is the actual data you want saved on the document.

file\_type\_js\_official app.js

    const createThing = document.getElementById('createThing');
    const thingsList = document.getElementById('thingsList');
    
    const db = firebase.firestore();
    let thingsRef;
    let unsubscribe;
    
    auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
    
        if (user) {
    
            // Database Reference
            thingsRef = db.collection('things')
    
            createThing.onclick = () => {
    
                const { serverTimestamp } = firebase.firestore.FieldValue;
    
                thingsRef.add({
                    uid: user.uid,
                    name: faker.commerce.productName(),
                    createdAt: serverTimestamp()
                });
            }
    
        }
    });
    

üí° Notice how I used `serverTimestamp()` and NOT a client-side source like `Date.now()` for the timestamp. This ensures you will have a consistent timestamp across all devices.

### Listening to a Realtime Query

Now that we can write to the database, let‚Äôs make a query to read data and listen to changes in realtime. Similar to user auth, a query has an `onSnapshot` method that fires a callback function whenever the underlying data changes.

file\_type\_js\_official app.js

    let thingsRef;
    let unsubscribe;
    
    auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
    
        if (user) {
    
            // Database Reference
            thingsRef = db.collection('things')
    
            // ..... omitted .....
    
            // Query
            unsubscribe = thingsRef.where('uid', '==', user.uid)
                .onSnapshot(querySnapshot => {
                    
                    // Map results to an array of li elements
    
                    const items = querySnapshot.docs.map(doc => {
    
                        return `<li>${doc.data().name}</li>`
    
                    });
    
                    thingsList.innerHTML = items.join('');
    
                });
    
    
    
        } else {
            // Unsubscribe when the user signs out
            unsubscribe && unsubscribe();
        }
    });
    
    

üí° Notice how we are defining the query‚Äôs return value as a variable named `unsubscribe` - this is a function we can call at some later point to turn-off the realtime subscription.

### Composite Indexes

Certain queries can only be performed if an index is in place. The browser console with throw an error with a link you can follow you to create the necessary index.

When combining a where method using `==` with a range operator like `<` or `orderBy` you will need an index, for example:

file\_type\_js\_official app.js

    thingsRef
        .where('uid', '==', user.uid)
        .orderBy('createdAt') // Requires an index
    

![When you see this error, follow the link to create a composite index](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/img/composite-index.png)

When you see this error, follow the link to create a composite index

### Security Rules

At some point, your database will need full server-side [security rules](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/snippets/firestore-rules-recipes/) in place. Without rules, your app is vulnerable to exploitation because any hacker could grab your project config start writing to Firestore.

The rules below ensure that (1) the entire database is locked down and (2) authenticated users can ONLY modify their own data. You can configure these rules from the _Database ¬ª Rules_

file\_type\_firebase firestore.rules

    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
        // Lock down the database
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if false; 
        
        // Allow authorized requests to the things collection
        match /things/{docId} {
          allow write: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uid;
          allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
        }
        
      }
    }
